This is a solution to the <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0">IP Address Tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor</a>! 

The second encounter with Frontend Mentor, meaning to let me include an API in a simple project.

### What I learned

Once again, during the challenge I focused on testing my React and Styled Components knowledge, but also included two APIs - Leaflet and IP Geolocation API. It turned out to be a good practice of including APIs into my code - as working with its documentations might be little more complicated than usually, and any help might be harder to obtain!

### Continued development

As this project was still one of my first projects made with React, I want to focus on clean code and good practice - especially once I get feedback on the code, so I can visit it back again.

In future projects, I would love to include Vue.js, but also test out my obtained CSS knowledge - and that's why I picked <a href="https://github.com/OktawiaRogowicz/ip-address-tracker"><strong>3. Chat app CSS illustration</strong></a>.
